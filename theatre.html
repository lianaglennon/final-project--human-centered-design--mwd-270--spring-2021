            <h1>theatre and its impact</h1>
            <p>I've been performing since I was little. I did smaller things in preschool and enjoyed it, but I actually hated my first musical Annie in kindergarten. I thought it was waaaay too much work and didn't audition for any of the plays again until 4th grade when my best friend put $20 on the table. She said if I didn't have fun, she would give me $20, which was basically a million dollars to a nine year old. I ended up loving it and I've been consistently performing ever since. I decided sophomore year of high school that I wanted to major in theatre for college. I was at a performance of Kinky Boots on Broadway and it really hit me that that was where I wanted to be. I ended up at Hartt not entirely by choice. It was the first school I auditioned for and heard back from, all the way back in Decemeber. I had auditions at around 10 more schools and only ended up getting into one more. Hartt was the better of the two, so I committed and packed up my things to move here in August of 2017. Since then I've grown a lot as an actor, met people who will be in my life forever, and I've really become an adult. The work ahead is daunting, but I'm excited for what is to come. Below are my two senior showcase pieces: Anywhere But Here and Waitin' For My Dearie. Perfect is from my Senior Honors Project: Edges by Pasek and Paul. Lastly, the video of God is a Woman by Ariana Grande is from my roommate Mario's project, Women Run Pop: The Basement Sessions, which highlighted different women pop artists and their impact on the industry.</p>
